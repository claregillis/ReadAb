Description: ReadAb is a package used to work with antibodies stored in PDB files.
        It facilitates the reading of antibodies from PDB files renumbered with 
        any of the Kabat, Chothia, IMGT, or AHo/Honegger schemes to denote 
        the locations of complimentarity determining regions (CDRs) (A.K.A. binding
        loops.) Enables researchers to compare binding specificity between multiple
        antibodies by comparing aligned loop sequences. ReadAb offers tools for 
        visualizing antibodies with color coded components (loops, antigen, other),
        and for visualizing loop similarity matrices using heatmaps.
